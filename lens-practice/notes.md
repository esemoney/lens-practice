In the `notebooksss\practice-one.ipynb` file, I connect to GraphQL using Python in Jupyter and query data from the lens api.

the modules I used are:
1. requests (used to connect to GraphQL)
2. json (used to parse GraphQL data)
3. pandas (used for improve readability of the data)

I connect to a GraphQL endpoint of the Lens api that does not require authentication.
